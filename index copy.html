        <div align=center><h1>Liv and Learn</h1></div>
        <div align=center><h3>A "Digital Scrapbook" of my college experience.</h3></div>
   
        <div id="intro" align=center>My name is Olivia, but my friends call me Liv, and this is my way of documenting my college journey. I plan to live a little and learn a lot so here's to the next four years, I hope they are filled with love, laughter, and lots of Tar Heel memories. <br><br></div>
        <div align=center><h2>Here is a little bit about me:</h2></div>
        <div class="bio" align=center>I am from Gray's Creek, NC a small community outside of Fayetteville, NC. I love my hometown and everything it has to offer. I enjoy reading books, I am always down for a beach trip, and I love photography (even though I am not very good). I am passionate about baseball, and you can always find me at the ballpark. My team is the Nationals and Bryce Harper only has a little bit to do with it. However if it isn't baseball season I also appreciate basketball, which might be beacuse I was raised on Tar Heel Basketball by a Hoosier, and grew up watching the greatest rivalry in college sports, Duke vs Carolina. I am a Carolina girl at heart so of course I attend the best University in the world, Unc Chapel Hill. I plan to major in PR at the Media and Journalism School and to obtain my Sports Communication Certificate. I want to work as the Director of Communication for a professional sports team. #GDTBATH #IbacktheNats <br><br></div>
